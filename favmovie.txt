My fav movie: Across the Universe

It is a movie based around the lives of around 7 main characters during the vietnam war.
It is cool becuase the movie is based completely around songs by the beatles but has nothing to do with the beatles.
It is kinda a movie/ musical and changes from the different POVs of each characters, although the characters all eventually connect.
